Please note in this exercise we are looking to identify technical areas for training. So, if we’re successful, we’ll have a foundation from which to identify the skills that we should hone together should we decide to move forward. 


Part 2: JavaScript
The goal of this exercise is:
Add functionality to the mockup above using jquery or plain javaScript. 
Please use comments to describe your javascript logic

Sync up the two checkboxes on the page so both check and uncheck at the same time. 

In the blue box  below the words, “TIME LEFT UNTIL THE WEBINAR STARTS...” please create a countdown timer. The timer should countdown to 5 days at midnight from when the page loads. 

Make it so when someone clicks either of the two blue buttons below the checkboxes and the checkboxes are not checked an alert appears asking the user to check the checkbox before proceeding. 

When the user clicks either of the two blue buttons below the checkboxes and the checkboxes are checked make a call to the following endpoint: 
https://ykx8pov945.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/test-Prod/testFunction
After receiving a response, below those buttons the value of the property submitok from that calls response..
